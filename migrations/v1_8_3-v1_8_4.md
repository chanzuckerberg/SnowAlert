## Azure Log Connector

### Removing Ingestion Runtime

In the v1.8.4 Azure Log DC, we ingest data using an external table over the Azure Stage, which allows us to ingest logs without a runtime piece and also logs that were appended to existing files.

If you'd like to migrate the Azure Log DC, you can do so with a snippet like â€”

~~~
USE ROLE snowalert;

DROP PIPE data.azure_log_default_operation_default_pipe;
DROP STAGE data.azure_log_default_operation_default_stage;

ALTER TABLE data.azure_log_default_operation_connection SET COMMENT='
---
module: azure_log
';

ALTER TABLE data.azure_log_default_operation_default_connection
   RENAME COLUMN properties_resource_locaation
              TO properties_resource_location;
~~~

And recreate the connection via the Data Connector WebUI. Since you are not dropping the connection table, you will not lose any of your historical data.
